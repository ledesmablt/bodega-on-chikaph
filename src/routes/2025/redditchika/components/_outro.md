I would have expected a gossip subreddit to be dominated by cheating scandals and the like,
but seems like having a good time and celebrating others' successes attracts just as much,
perhaps even more, attention.

It's interesting to see pop culture obsession in action — droves of comments with thousands of upvotes,
witty comebacks and remarks, posts that rally people together or get polarized responses.
While I’m just still way out of the loop with celebrity gossip,
I’ve slowly come to appreciate the internet hivemind of r/ChikaPH.

**TODO write the rest of the outro / conclusion!** Thanks for reading! :)
