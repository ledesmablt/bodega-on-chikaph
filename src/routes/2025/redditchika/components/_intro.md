When I’m not surfing Reddit for answers to things like "(show I just watched) ending explained" or 
"best budget earphones 2025", browsing the pinoy subreddits is always a good time.

You’ll never quite know what crazy shit people are saying on r/AkoBaYungGago or on r/OffMyChestPH.
A well-worded comment from r/phtravel can sometimes be all it takes to decide if I’ll book a plane ticket or not.

But among all the Filipino subs I've come across, **r/ChikaPH** in particular seems to be mentioned
the most often among my friends. At the time of writing, the sub's nearing 1 million followers — around 1 in 
every hundred people in the country! A lot of people are in the know - I'd like to at least be a little bit less
out of the loop.

I was curious to see what I might find by diving into the sub.
Doing so would also help me catch up with most relevant pop culture topics I missed from the start of 2024.
Friends have briefed me about some topics — especially the KathNiel breakup and the Maris & Anthony issue — but
I don’t know what I don’t know.

I felt like I could find the answers on the sub, and that there were a better way than scrolling
through months and months of data. As a starting point, I went with the 30 most upvoted posts from
January 2024 to June 2025.
