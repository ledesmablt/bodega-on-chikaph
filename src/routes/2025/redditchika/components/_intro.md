When I’m not surfing Reddit for answers to things like _"(insert name of show) ending explained"_ or 
_"best budget earphones 2025"_, you can probably find me lurking on the Pinoy subreddits. Time and time again, I'm surprised by how much more
there is to enjoy than I might expect.

Week on week, I can count on someone to be saying some crazy shit on [r/OffMyChestPH](https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/) or [r/AkoBaYungGago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AkoBaYungGago/).
A well-worded comment from [r/phtravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/phtravel/) can sometimes be all it takes to decide if I’ll book a plane ticket or not.
I might extend my travel research with queries like _"hidden gem restaurants"_ on [r/Cebu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cebu/).
(To the person who asked the exact same thing two years ago and to the user with the top comment — the place is still alive on Google Maps! — thank you.)

But among all the Filipino subs I've come across, [**r/ChikaPH**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChikaPH/) in particular seems to be almost a
buzzword among friends. I feel its rising popularity online and offline; the sub is approaching one million followers, and more and more often I hear it mentioned around me.
To escape the growing feeling that I live under a rock, I figured it was about time for me to get in the loop, even if just by a little bit.

Friends have briefed me about the essentials — celebrity breakups and scandals, annoying and cringe influencers they hate,
and other news that made rounds on social media and groupchats last year.
Briefs on the topics were helpful and entertaining, yet I found myself still curious about details surrounding some issues,
how many other people reacted the same way, and if anyone thought differently or had something interesting to say.

I felt like I could find some answers by diving into r/ChikaPH, at the time still an enigma to me,
and catch up with news, trends, and other internet _chismis_ I missed from the past year and a half.

Scrolling through months and months of posts, however, didn't feel like the right approach for me.
I wanted to get only the most relevant stuff and a bird's eye view of the sub.
As a starting point, I went with the **30 most upvoted posts from January 2024 to June 2025**.
