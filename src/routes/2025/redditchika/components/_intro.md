When I’m not surfing Reddit for answers to things like _"(insert name of show) ending explained"_ or 
_"best budget earphones 2025"_, browsing the pinoy subreddits is always a good time.

You’ll never quite know what crazy shit people are saying on [r/AkoBaYungGago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AkoBaYungGago/) or [r/OffMyChestPH](https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/).
A well-researched comment from [r/phtravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/phtravel/) can sometimes be all it takes to decide if I’ll book a plane ticket or not.

But among all the Filipino subs I've come across, [**r/ChikaPH**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChikaPH/) in particular seems to be mentioned
the most often among my friends. The sub has been approaching a million followers at the time of writing — around 1 in 
every 100 people in the country! Many others are in the know, and I'd like to be a little less
out of the loop.

Friends have briefed me about the essentials — especially the KathNiel breakup and Maris & Anthony issue,
both of which made rounds on news outlets and social media last year.
But I still had questions about some of the finer details,
and if there's any other news I might find interesting. What and who are people talking about nowadays?

I was curious to see if I could dive into the sub and catch up to news, trends, and other internet _chismis_ from
the past year and a half.

Scrolling through months and months of data, however, felt like too much work to me.
I wanted to get only the most relevant stuff and a bird's eye view of the sub.
As a starting point, I went with the **30 most upvoted posts from January 2024 to June 2025**.
